This program provides an example (on Apple's iOS) for how to get audio data from the microphone and reroute it to be heard through the speaker.

This is based on:

If you don't know anything about digital audio or the core audio framework, I advice you read
Apple's "Core Audio overview" to get some idea of what you're doing.

Simply open the project in xcode, and press "Build and Run".
